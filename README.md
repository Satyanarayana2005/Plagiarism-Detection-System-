# Plagiarism-Detection-System-
My Mini Project
 
  📝 Description : 
             The Plagiarism Detection System is a software tool designed to identify similarities between text documents and detect potential plagiarism. The system compares input text with existing documents and calculates a similarity score using text-matching techniques.
This project is developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the development environment and is intended for academic, educational, and research purposes.
  🎯 Objectives: 
            Detect plagiarism between multiple text files
            Calculate similarity percentage between documents
            Help students and educators ensure originality
            Provide an easy-to-use and efficient plagiarism checking tool
  🛠️ Technologies Used
          Programming Language: Python
          Development Environment: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
     Libraries / Concepts:
        File handling
        String matching
        Text preprocessing
        Similarity algorithms (e.g., cosine similarity / Jaccard similarity)
 ⚙️ Features
      Upload or input text files
      Compare multiple documents
      Display similarity percentage
      Identify plagiarized content
      Simple and user-friendly implementation
🧠 How It Works
     The user provides text files or input text
     The system preprocesses the text (removes punctuation, converts to lowercase, etc.)
     Text similarity is calculated using matching algorithms
     The final plagiarism percentage is displayed,
